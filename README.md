# BankTransactionPresentation
This project was created to quickly demonstrate how data from a source like Excel can be presented visually. As a side effect it may also make you more conscious about your spending habits.

Using Pandas and MathLabPlot this program quickly shows a number of debited or credited transactions on a bank statement.

The statement file included in the repository originally included more headings and information, of course this being on the internet, it all had to be removed.
